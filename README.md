Table with sort and search etc, using Bootstrap (For results with many records) - Serve-Side

I recently demonstrated an example table using the bootstrap.

In it were presented some interesting functions and that can be useful in several projects. We use as base DataTable.js, which provides us with some facilities, such as sorting by columns, searching within the table and paging.
